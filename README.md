# Bank System Project

This is a readme file for the Bank System project implemented in Solidity. The project aims to create a basic banking system using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.


## Prerequisites
To run and test the Bank System project, you need to have the following software installed:

- Solidity compiler
- Ethereum client (such as Ganache or geth)
- Truffle (optional but recommended for deployment and testing)
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
- git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies:
- npm install
Compile the smart contract:
- truffle compile
Deploy the smart contract:
- truffle migrate

## Usage
Once the smart contract is deployed, you can interact with the Bank system using the provided functions. The BankSystem.sol contract contains the following functions:

- deposit: Allows users to deposit funds into their bank account.
- transfer: Allows users to transfer funds from their bank account.
- withdraw: Allows users to withdraw funds from their bank account.
- getBalance: Returns the account balance of a user.
You can use an Ethereum client or web3 libraries to interact with the deployed contract and call these functions.
